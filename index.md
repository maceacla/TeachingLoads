# Introduction: Towards a Data-Informed Evaluation of Teaching Load

The objective of this report is to provide a basis upon which teaching load can be evaluated and compared. The workload associated with teaching a course can vary significantly based on factors and by quantifying and comparing these factors, we aim to develop a methodology for ranking courses based on their associated workload.

The proposed ranking system considers several key factors that contribute to a professor's workload, including student enrollment, the availability of teaching assistant (TA) support, and the number of associated laboratory or problem analysis (PA) sections. Specifically, the methodology incorporates the following principles and constraints:

* **TA Allocation:** Graduate-level courses (those in the 5XXX series) are assumed to operate without dedicated TAs. For undergraduate courses, TA allocation is based on a ratio of one TA per 50 enrolled students per course.
* **Contact Hours:** We assume that professor contact hours are directly proportional to the number of students enrolled in the course.
* **TA and Lab/PA Management:** The time commitment required for managing TAs and coordinating lab/PA sections is assumed to scale with the number of these sections.
* **Manual Overrides:**  Acknowledging the unique demands of certain foundational courses, we manually rank ECOR 1043 and ECOR 1044 as "Very High" workload for the Fall and Winter semesters. For their Summer offerings, they will be ranked using the standard methodology. Conversely, ECOR 1055 and ECOR 4995 are consistently ranked as "Low" workload.

To provide a granular assessment, the ranking will be conducted on a **per-section basis**. For courses with multiple sections, we assume that students are distributed proportionally among the sections. While this is not strictly accurate, it provides a reasonable approximation of the workload distribution.

This report will present three distinct course rankings, one for each course given in a semester of either the 2023-2024 or 2024-2025 academic years (Fall, Winter, and Summer). The most recently taught offering of the course was considered for each course, for a given semester. Semester rankings are provided for courses that may be offered in more than one semester because the enrollment can vary signficantly depending on the time of year a course is given. 

## Most Recent Course Summary and Proposed Workload Rankings

This section presents a comprehensive analysis of course workloads based on the most recent offerings in each term. We provide both raw data summaries and calculated workload rankings using three distinct methodologies. The analysis accounts for various factors including enrollment numbers, teaching assistant support, and laboratory/tutorial components, while incorporating specific overrides for certain foundational courses.

Raw teaching data was obtained through Banner reports. The raw data is not presented here due to its size and complexity, but the summary tables and workload rankings are based on this data. The workload rankings are calculated using the methodologies outlined below, with specific considerations for course-specific requirements and constraints.

1. **Three summary tables** (one for Fall, one for Winter, one for Summer) of the **most recent** offerings.  
   - Each table has columns for **Course**, **Enrollment**, **\#Sections**, **\#Labs/PA** (ignoring instructors).  
   - Courses are in **alphanumeric order**.

2. **Three workload ranking tables** (one for each season) showing each course’s ranking by three different methods:
   - **Method 1**: _Enrollment-biased_  
   - **Method 2**: _Balanced_  
   - **Method 3**: _Section+TA-biased_  
   - Plus a final “**Majority**” column containing the most common of the three rankings.

In accordance with special instructions:
- **ECOR 1043** and **ECOR 1044** are forced to "**Very high**" in Fall and Winter.
- **ECOR 1055** is always "**Low**."
- **ECOR 4995** is always "**Low**."
- For **Summer**, these courses are not forced to "Very high" or "Low" but follow the general methods (except for the continuing rule that 1055 and 4995 remain Low).
- Graduate (5XXX) courses get **no TAs** (affects methods 2 and 3 since TAs factor into workload).
- TAs are allocated for undergraduate courses at **1 TA per 50** enrolled students, per course (not per section).  
- Rankings are **per-section**: a professor teaching one section of a multi-section course gets a proportional share of enrollment, labs, etc.
- We iterated on the 2xxx-level courses to ensure there is a noticeable difference between a purely enrollment-biased system (Method 1) and a more section/TA-biased system (Method 3).

# Proposed Workload Ranking

We provide **three** categorization methods:

1. **Method 1 (Enrollment-biased)**  
   - Ranks primarily by per-section enrollment (the more students, the higher the category).  
   - Does not heavily factor in labs or TAs other than the effect of raw enrollment.  
   - Threshold example (per-section):
     - < 30 ⇒ **Low**  
     - 30–60 ⇒ **Medium**  
     - 61–120 ⇒ **High**  
     - \> 120 ⇒ **Very high**  

2. **Method 2 (Balanced)**  
   - Looks at per-section enrollment and the presence of labs/TAs.  
   - Weighted roughly half on enrollment, half on number of labs and TAs.  
   - E.g., a course with moderate enrollment but many lab sections may push from Low to Medium or High.  

3. **Method 3 (Section+TA-biased)**  
   - Strongly factors in number of TAs (which depends on total enrollment, but 1 TA per 50 undergrad students) and the total lab/PA sections.  
   - A 2xxx-level course with many labs can see a jump in the ranking even if the enrollment is moderate.  

**Special overrides**:
- **ECOR 1043** and **ECOR 1044** are "**Very high**" in Fall/Winter for all methods.
- **ECOR 1055** is "**Low**" for all methods (any season).
- **ECOR 4995** is "**Low**" for all methods (any season).

Because of the “per-section” approach, if a course has multiple sections, each professor sees only a fraction of the total enrollment. For example, a course with total enrollment 300 and 3 sections has a per-section enrollment of 100. TAs are allocated at the course level but we assume the time managing TAs is distributed across sections proportionally.

Below, each table is for a **season** (Fall, Winter, Summer) in **alphanumeric order of course**. Columns show:
- Method 1 rank
- Method 2 rank
- Method 3 rank
- **Majority** rank (most common of the three).

We’ve iterated especially on 2xxx-level courses to show a difference: e.g., **ELEC 2501** might be “High” in Method 1 (due to decent per-section enrollment) but in Method 3 it could become “Very high” if labs and TAs are numerous. Conversely, some 2xxx courses with fewer labs might stay “Medium” in Method 3. Graduate courses (5xxx) have no TAs, often small enrollment, so frequently “Low” or “Medium.”

**Notes**:  
- (†) indicates the special overriding rule.  
- **ELEC 2501** stands out in Method 3 as “Very high” (many labs + TAs for large total enrollment) but only “High” in Method 1/2 since per-section is moderate. This highlights the difference in purely enrollment-based vs. section+TA-based ranking for a 2xxx course.

**Notes**:  
- **ECOR 1043** and **ECOR 1044** forcibly “Very high” across all methods.  
- **ELEC 3605**: total enrollment is 209 in one section, so the per-section is 209 (Method 1 = High). But it has quite a few labs (6) and TAs (floor(209/50)=4), so in Method 3 we push it to “Very high.”  
- Similarly, **ELEC 2507** also jumps to “Very high” in Method 3 given multiple labs and TAs.

| **ELEC 3909**  | Low           | Low            | Low                | Low       |

**Notes**:  
- Summer enrollments are modest for **ECOR 1043** / **ECOR 1044**, so no forced “Very high” label here. Per the thresholds, each section has 80 or 71 students in a single section. That lands in the “Medium” range for Method 1. The labs are not excessive; TAs are fewer (floor(80/50)=1 or floor(71/50)=1). Thus it stays at “Medium” in Method 3 as well.  
- **ECOR 1055** is not listed in Summer data (not offered).  
- **ELEC 2501** and **ELEC 2507** each have ~60–70 enrollment in one section, with 4 labs, plus TAs. This pushes them from “Medium” in purely enrollment-based to “High” in the other two methods.  
- **ECOR 4995** remains “Low.”

## Methodology Summary

1. **Method 1 (Enrollment-biased)**  
   - Sort courses by **per-section enrollment**. Use threshold bands for Low/Medium/High/Very high.  
   - Labs/TAs matter only insofar as they reflect more or fewer students overall, but not explicitly counted.

2. **Method 2 (Balanced)**  
   - Start with per-section enrollment category from Method 1.  
   - If the course has a high ratio of labs to sections, or many TAs, we may increase the category by one rung.

3. **Method 3 (Section + TA-biased)**  
   - Factor total TAs = floor(total enrollment / 50) for undergrad courses.  
   - Factor the number of labs/PA sections.  
   - If labs + TAs are large, we may boost it by one or even two rungs from the baseline. For instance, a large-lab 2xxx course can become “Very high” even if per-section enrollment is moderate.

**Graduate courses** (5xxx) get **no TAs**, and typically have small enrollment, so they almost invariably rank “Low.”  

Finally, the “**Majority**” column is whichever category (Low, Medium, High, Very high) appears **most often** among the three methods for that course in that season.

## Using the Teaching Load Rankings

Generally when assigning courses to faculty members, the workload is a key consideration. The workload is often determined by the number of students in the course, the number of lab sections, and the availability of teaching assistants. The workload ranking system proposed in this report provides a structured approach to evaluating the teaching load associated with different courses.

### Summary of Best Pairings
- High + Low: Ideal to balance heavy courses with lighter ones.
- Medium + Low: Promotes moderate workloads.
- Low + Low: Useful for terms with additional administrative or research responsibilities.
- High + Medium: Only when absolutely necessary, and to be avoided in consecutive terms.  

### Pairings to be Avoided
- High + High: This pairing will not leave time for other activities.

These combinations provide flexibility while ensuring workloads remain manageable and aligned with teaching preferences.

### Strategies for Balancing Workloads

An available option for some instructors is to spread out their individual workload across three terms, in which case pairings are less of an issue. For example, demanding courses can be delivered in Fall or Winter, with a lighter course in Summer. This allows for a more balanced workload distribution.

Ideally teaching assignments will take the workload rankings into account to ensure a fair distribution of courses among faculty members. By considering the workload rankings, the department can optimize the allocation of courses to faculty members based on their preferences, expertise, and availability. This can lead to a more balanced and equitable distribution of teaching responsibilities, ultimately benefiting both faculty members and students.

Instructors should monitor their teaching loads across successive academic years to ensure teaching loads are balanced and aligned with their preferences and career goals. By using the workload rankings as a guide, instructors can make informed decisions about their teaching assignments and workloads, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and rewarding teaching experience.
